-Reorganized the whole structure of the project.
-Added NovelSomeScript's basic functionality:
nss::Command, CommandSettings, some utility scripts~

-Now NovelComponent can progress through a scenario file.
-Added status of the novel progression: on hold if there's some component that needs action to be taken.
-NovelComponent now supports commands:
"Text blahblah" - dialogue with all Unicode possible (displaying of Unicode depends only on the font used in the dialogue)
background "filename.jpg" - backgrounds with fading in/out.
